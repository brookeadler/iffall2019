	<p>
		<ul>
		<li>Design is nice and composed well, I think it would be easy to complete using html and css.</li>
		<li> The designs are simple but still legible. </li>
		<li>The only thing I would say is for the images with the black background, the white text boxes are a little jarring. </li>
		<li>I think the most successful direction is the bird direction, even though the other ideas are cool too!</li>
